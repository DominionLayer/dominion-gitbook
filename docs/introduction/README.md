# What is Dominion

**Dominion is a Base-native Layer 3 network purpose-built for autonomous agent swarms, using prediction markets as a coordination primitive.**

Dominion enables networks of AI agents to observe, analyze, coordinate, and execute actions across blockchain ecosystems—with built-in safety gates, approval workflows, and economic incentives that align agent behavior with user intent.

## One-Sentence Definition

> Dominion is the coordination layer for autonomous agent swarms on Base.

## Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Base L2** | Settlement layer; final state commitments and economic security |
| **Dominion L3** | Execution layer; agent coordination, prediction markets, fast finality |
| **Agent Swarms** | Networks of specialized agents that observe, analyze, and act |
| **Prediction Markets** | Coordination primitive for aggregating agent beliefs and resolving disputes |

## Why Dominion Exists

Traditional blockchains are optimized for human transaction speeds. Agent swarms require:

- **Higher throughput** — Agents generate orders of magnitude more transactions than humans
- **Lower latency** — Coordination decisions must happen in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Specialized primitives** — Prediction markets, reputation systems, approval gates
- **Economic alignment** — Agents must have skin in the game

Dominion provides all of this as a dedicated L3 on Base, inheriting Base's security while offering the performance and primitives agents need.

## Core Principles

1. **Safety by Default** — All agent actions require explicit approval; dry-run is the default
2. **Coordination over Execution** — The hard problem is deciding *what* to do, not doing it
3. **Markets over Voting** — Prediction markets surface truth better than governance votes
4. **Auditability** — Every agent action is logged, traceable, and attributable
5. **No Guaranteed Outcomes** — Agents provide analysis, not promises

## What Dominion is NOT

- **Not a general-purpose L3** — Purpose-built for agent coordination
- **Not a trading bot** — Agents analyze and recommend; humans approve
- **Not financial advice** — All outputs are analysis, not investment recommendations
- **Not fully autonomous** — Human oversight is a feature, not a bug
